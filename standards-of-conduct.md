# Standards of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

The Perl Foundation believes our community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or country of origin

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior. We invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, vendors, and other participants to help us realize a safe and positive conference experience for everyone.

## 2. Scope

We expect all event participants (sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, vendors, and other guests) to abide by this code of conduct at all conference venues and conference-related social events.

## 3. Expected Behavior

* Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
* Alert conference organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any attendees. The Perl Conference venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior by other attendees, organizers, venue staff, sponsors, or other patrons of The Perl Conference venues will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If anyone engages in unacceptable behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate including expulsion from the conference without warning or refund.

## 6. Reporting Incidents

If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a member of the SoC Event Committee as soon as possible. If you do not know who these members are, ask any event organizer or volunteer for help. You may also email [soc@perlconference.us](mailto:soc@perlconference.us) to report an incident if you prefer.

## 7. Standard of Conduct Committee

Each event will establish a standards of conduct committee (SoC Committee) and a chairperson for that committee. The point of contact for this committee will be published on the event website. The SoC Committee will be responsible for receiving and handling all incident reports. The SoC Committee is authorized to establish any supplemental procedures necessary to fulfill their role, provided that any such procedures are subject to approval by The Perl Foundation.
